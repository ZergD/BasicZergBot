# Work in progress on SC2 bot

The idea is to use SC2 for AI playground.

- Let's try to hardcode a bot that can win against easy computer as zerg
- Next step will be to try && use maybe DI Engine.

### Progress list

- Created bot_v0.0.py : As Protoss, it creates probes and just sends it to 4 points around main Nexus.
North, East, South, West.
- Next idea is to create a simple Zerg bot that could win against ez Terran.
